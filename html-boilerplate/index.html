<!--we should name the html file htat contains the homepage as 'index' always-->

<!--bcz servers looks for that-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--doctype tells browser version of html to be rendered-->
<html lang="en">

	<!--imp for stuff like texttospeach-->

	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<title>My First Webpagee</title>
		<!--UTF-8 in meta is imp because it will make sure to render other language chars and special chars correctly like emojis nd stuff too-->
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<em>Emphasized text</em>
		<p>or we can just call it itallic
		<b>b for bold ig</b>
		all these elements are like siblings while the parent is body
		<strong>strong also bolds?</strong></p>
		<h2>it doesn't</h2>
		<p>do not use b and i for italic and bold because they are not very helpful for backend, like its just visual representation but not giving any meaning for ppl using screen reader</p>
		<!--reference for difference https://youtu.be/gW6cBZLUk6M?si=Fpjs9oxv2eUVVgS8 AND h7 doesnt exist and do not hold any meaning only h6 does-->

		<p>this is list unordered for things where chronology doesnt matter </p>
		<ul>
			<li>item1</li>
			<li>item2</li>
			<li>item3</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and this is ordered list</p>
		<ol>
			<li>item1</li>
			<li>item2</li>
